# Other Essential Control Theory Concepts
Instead of repeating information that is already available online, we're sharing a link to another great guide. This guide focuses specifically on control theory in FTC robotics. We strongly suggest reading through all the sections, as it covers almost everything you need to understand about control theory for programming in FTC. At the very least, check out the part about PID control.
