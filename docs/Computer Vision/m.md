# Computer Vision Simulators

Using simulation software you can use images that you have saved from the robot's camera steam to test your computer vision code without a physical robot. 

### OpenCV 

The FTC community has created an excellent simulator to test your OpenCV pipelines: ECOV Sim. Simply upload the image into the software and link your pipeline file to test your code. The documentation regarding running the simulator is already very comprehensive so we will just provide the link:

### Vuforia 

Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any Vuforia simulation software specifically made for FTC robotics.
