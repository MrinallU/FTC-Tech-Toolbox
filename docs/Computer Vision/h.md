### Setting up the Account
To utilize the FTC Machine Learning feature, you need to have an account and be paired with a team on the FTC site. Then you can go [here](https://ftc-ml.firstinspires.org/), to login to the ML toolchain.

### Creating a Video of the Object

Your first step, is to create a video of the desired object. Due to the fact that there are many frames to analyze in a video, the FTC-ML Toolchain uses videos instead of images to recognize the image. Ideally, you should be using the camera used on your robot to take the videos from about the height that it will be on your robot, this ensures highest accuracy. 

### Video Upload

Now you need to upload your video to the ML software. On the FTC-ML dashboard, hit the upload video file, and select the video file from your computer. Wait some time, and the video will upload and the frames will be extracted and appear in the Contents Tab. After fully loading, the video description will become a link, click on the link to get the next step.
