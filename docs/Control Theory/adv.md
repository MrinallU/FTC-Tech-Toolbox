# Resources for Learning Advanced Control Theory

### Controls Engineering in FRC
Creating a segment dedicated to advanced control theory isn't necessary, given the availability of a free textbook designed to teach high school students graduate-level control theory specifically within the context of FIRST robotics. Additionally, this code includes multiple software implementations of these concepts. This enables you to experiment with incorporating these ideas into your control system.

Keep in mind that this book is a valuable resource for learning modern control theory concepts. However, applying some of the more advanced ideas from the book might require a significant time investment. This could lead to diminishing returns in your control system compared to the time spent. To make the best use of your time, I recommend trying out these concepts during the off-season for learning purposes only. When the actual season is underway, it's a good idea to switch back to a standard control method like PID.

### MPC Lib
In the given GitHub repository, you'll discover a library that facilitates the application of numerous concepts outlined in the book, such as LQR and Models for mecanum drive. Furthermore, within the examples folder, you'll find practical implementations of several advanced concepts highlighted in this guide, including Pure Pursuit and GVF. It's important to note that the repository lacks comprehensive documentation, which means you'll probably need to invest a substantial amount of time to understand and decipher the code effectively.
