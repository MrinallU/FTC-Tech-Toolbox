# VRS
:::caution
Note that VRS does not support external libraries such as RoadRunner and EasyOpenCV. Therefore, we recommend that most teams stick to using the 2D simulator listed in the previous section.
:::

The Virtual Robot Simulator is a very useful, 3D robot simulator that teams can test JAVA and block code on. It provides a 3D representation of the POWERPLAY field for teams to test their robot out.
