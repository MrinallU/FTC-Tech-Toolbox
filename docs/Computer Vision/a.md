Each season, FTC has some vision-related task during autonomous, it is usually the biggest haul. Therefore, to have a competitive autonomous, it is vital to get a camera on your robot and get a vision system working.

### Recommended Cameras

* [Logitech C270](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c270-hd-webcam.960-000694.html)
* [Logitech C310](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c310-hd-webcam.960-000585.html)
* [Logitech C920](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c920s-pro-hd-webcam.960-001257.html)

Once you have the camera you are using, you can plug it into the USB 2.0 port on the Control Hub.

### Vuforia vs OpenCV

The two main libraries used for vision detection are the Vuforia and OpenCV libraries. This guide will go over the implementation of both. However, our team highly recommends the use of OpenCV due to the more reliable results and in-depth capabilities.
