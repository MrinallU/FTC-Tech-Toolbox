# Flywheels / Shooters

A flywheel is typically known as a wheel attached to a motor, that spins to complete some sort of task. Here are some potential use cases from previous games:

Although for most use cases, connecting the motor to an encoder and setting appropriate tick velocities to rev up the flywheel should suffice for most teams. There are some advanced techniques that teams can make use of in special cases.

## Setting Shooter Powers Via Linear Regression: 
When attempting to shoot an object at a certain distance away from a target, knowing what power to set can often be a mystery without performing intensive calculations. However, by making use of linear regression, we can easily calculate the correct power that one must apply to the flywheel motor to hit the target.
